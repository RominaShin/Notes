    "Background: Information devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and E-readers, are widely used by Americans today. A survey conducted by Pew Research Center in January of 2018, asked a random sample of Americans to report which of these specific information devices they own. The study revealed that 53% of the Americans who were surveyed own a tablet (based on a random sample of 526 Americans). From these results, the 90% confidence interval for the population proportion of Americans who own a tablet was reported to be (0.4942, 0.5658).  \n",
    "* the value of 53% corresponds Sample Proportion , Estimate of the population proportion and Statistics\n",
    "* as the confidence interval grows, the interval becomes wider\n",
    "* with every new sample we take, we'll get a new confidence interval. We should not state a specific interval in the interpretation of a confidence level.\n",
    "* we must think about our entire interval as it is a range of reasonable values for the true proportion. \n",
    "* not appropriate to say  â€œWe estimate that 53% of all Americans own a tablet with a 90% margin of error of 3.58%.\"\n",
    "* If the researcher would like to have their confidence interval be narrower, more precise, he must Change the confidence level to 90%\n",
    "* Based on the reported 95% confidence interval, does it appear there is a minority of group with proportion of 43%? yes, because the entire interval is below 50%\n",
