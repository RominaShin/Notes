    "1. __What built-in data types are used in Python?__  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Number (int, float, long and complex) (not double)\n",
    "String (str)\n",
    "Tuple (tuple)\n",
    "Range (range)\n",
    "List (list)\n",
    "Set (set)\n",
    "Dictionary (dict)\n",
    "None\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __What is the difference between “is” and “==”?__  \n",
    "is checks identity and == checks equality. We can verify this by printing their object id’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __What is the difference between lists and tuples in Python?__  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Lists are mutable, which means they can be modified after being created. Tuples are immutable, which means they cannot be modified.  \n",
    "immutable data types include numeric data types (boolean, float, etc.), strings, frozensets and tuples.  \n",
    "Because tuples are immutable, they require less memory and are subsequently faster.  \n",
    "Use tuples instead of lists for functions that need to return multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Is Python an object-oriented programming language?__  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Yes and no. Python combines features of both object-oriented programming (OOP) and aspect-oriented programming. One reason it can’t be considered a true OOP language is that it doesn’t support strong encapsulation, which is the only basic feature of an OOP that Python does not support.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. __What is a compound datatype?__  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Compound data structures are single variables that represent multiple values. Some of the most common in Python are:\n",
    "Lists, Tuples, Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "13. __What is tuple unpacking? Why is it important?__  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The short answer: Unpacking refers to the practice of assigning elements of a tuple to multiple variables. You use the * operator to assign elements of an unpacking assignment to assign it a value.  \n",
    "count, fruit, price = (2, 'apple', 3.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "14. __What’s the difference between / and // in Python?__  \n",
    "Both / and // are division operators. However, / does float division, dividing the first operand by the second. / returns the value in decimal form. // does floor division, dividing the first operand by the second, but returns the value in natural number form.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. __Explain the zip() and enumerate() functions.__  \n",
    "The enumerate() function returns the indexes of all items in lists, dictionaries, sets and other iterables. The zip() function combines multiple iterables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    a = ['a','b','c']\n",
    "    b = [1,2,3]\n",
    "    [(k,v) for k,v in zip(a,b)]\n",
    "    #=> [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. __What is a decorator?__  \n",
    "A decorator allows adding functionality to an existing function by passing that existing function to a decorator, which executes the existing function as well as additional code.  \n",
    "You use the decorator to alter the functionality of a function without having to modify the functions code.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __What is the difference between instance, static and class methods in python?__  \n",
    "    - instance methods are methods that are bound to an instance of a class. They can access and modify the instance's attributes and state, and can be called on any instance of the class. Instance methods are defined using the self parameter, which refers to the instance that the method is called on.  \n",
    "    - Class methods, on the other hand, are methods that are bound to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class. They can access and modify class-level attributes and state, and can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator, and take a <b>cls</b> parameter, which refers to the class that the method is called on.\n",
    "    With staticmethods, neither self (the object instance) nor cls (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class.  \n",
    "    A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can’t access or modify it.\n",
    "    We generally use the class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.  \n",
    "    - Static methods : use @staticmethod decorator, are not related to a specific instance, and are self-contained, We generally use static methods to create utility functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class MyClass:\n",
    "        count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            MyClass.count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        @classmethod\n",
    "        def get_count(cls):\n",
    "            return cls.count\n",
    "        \n",
    "        @staticmethod\n",
    "        def static_func(x):\n",
    "            return x\n",
    "\n",
    "    # create some instances of MyClass\n",
    "    obj1 = MyClass()\n",
    "    obj2 = MyClass()\n",
    "    obj3 = MyClass()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # call the class method on the class itself\n",
    "    result = MyClass.get_count()\n",

    "    #=> [['a'], ['b'], ['c'], ['d']]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Create a shallow copy of the original. We can do this with the list() constructor, or the more pythonic mylist.copy() \n",
    "A shallow copy creates a new object, but fills it with references to the original. So adding a new object to the original collection, li3, doesn’t propagate to li4, but modifying one of the objects in li3 will propagate to li4.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    li3 = [['a'],['b'],['c']]\n",
